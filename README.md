# Rails Mailer

In this example we looked at Rails Mailers and used SendGrid as the third party service.

## Docs Used

1. Rails mailers https://guides.rubyonrails.org/action_mailer_basics.html
2. Sendgrid docs https://sendgrid.com/docs/for-developers/sending-email/rubyonrails

## Note

You need to add a single sender verified email.

This can be configured on the Sendgrid dashboard under Settings > Sender Authentication.
